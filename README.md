# üè¶ PoolPays - Decentralized Liquidity Protocol for Casinos

Automated liquidity management system built on the Arbitrum network, designed to manage investor deposits and direct them to Uniswap V3 liquidity pools, maintaining complete transparency and on-chain traceability.

## üìã Overview

PoolPays is a decentralized protocol that manages USDC deposits and automatically allocates them to the WETH/USDC Uniswap V3 liquidity pool. The system maintains individualized records for each depositor through on-chain events, allowing withdrawals at any time while funds generate returns through revenues from partner casinos around the world.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### **Main Contract - Liquidity Administrator**
- **Address**: [0x1D262425dc046b8bb26B4DB4f4Cd754804208049](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1D262425dc046b8bb26B4DB4f4Cd754804208049)
- **Function**: Receives USDC deposits from all participants and automatically adds liquidity to the Uniswap V3 pool
- **Target Pool**: [WETH/USDC Uniswap V3](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc6962004f452be9203591991d15f6b388e09e8d0#asset-tokens)

### **Tracking System**
Through events emitted by the contract, the PoolPays system:
- Proportionally reserves liquidity for each depositor
- Maintains individual records of deposited amounts
- Allows free withdrawals at any time
- Guarantees complete transparency via blockchain

### **Fund Separation - Two Independent Contracts**

#### **Payer 1 - Investor Pool**
- **Address**: [0x0c1133d9bc4d4ad6c439888ab4b4cb26b997aed0](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0c1133d9bc4d4ad6c439888ab4b4cb26b997aed0)
- **Purpose**: Distribution of returns to liquidity pool investors
- **Source**: Revenues generated by players from partner casinos worldwide
- **Management System**: Operates independently without authorization system - fully autonomous reward distribution

#### **Payer 2 - Casino Treasury** 
- **Address**: [0x43DFb116A20dBb7085FBf8aB68E085b269158117](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x43DFb116A20dBb7085FBf8aB68E085b269158117)
- **Purpose**: Payment of winning bets
- **Isolation**: Completely separated from investor funds
- **Limitation**: Access restricted only to player balances
- **Management System**: Utilizes `Authorized.sol` access control system required for all participating casinos

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Both contracts are completely independent with different management systems. The casino contract (Payer 2) uses role-based authorization while the investor contract (Payer 1) operates autonomously. Neither has access to the other's funds, ensuring total segregation.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap and Governance

### **1. Contract Deployment**
- Contract developed and deployed by wallet: `0xfD878CC322Aa83A7F23b53b3FAE5b2c92dbCfa6A`
- All permissions and roles configured

### **2. Administrative Privilege Renunciation**
- **Transaction Hash**: [0x80656cc74b33f5fff2a34439e733803940ce6afa5aee3a2412a0638b71d31266](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x80656cc74b33f5fff2a34439e733803940ce6afa5aee3a2412a0638b71d31266)
- Creator revoked **all** ADMIN permissions
- Contract now operates in a decentralized manner
- **Irreversible**: No entity can recover administrative control

### **3. Audit by Partner Casinos**
- Source code verified and publicly available on Arbiscan
- Audit performed by all partner casinos before operation
- Complete transparency of on-chain operations
- **Audited Engineering Structure**: System designed and verified to ensure all depositors always have unrestricted access to their funds, with the ability to withdraw at any time

### **4. Authorized Operator**
- **Operator Address**: `0xa2616e2daa321bebc7381f00697c5ad80b6b0f11`
- Only authorized address to execute revenue distributions
- Granular permission system (does not have administrative control)

## üîê Security and Transparency

### **Wallets with Advanced Mnemonic Entropy**
All operational wallets in the system use mnemonic seeds generated with high cryptographic entropy (256 bits), following BIP39/BIP44 standards, ensuring:
- Impossibility of prediction or brute force
- Multiple layers of hierarchical derivation
- Protection against collision attacks

### **Liquidity Guarantee for Depositors**
The protocol has an engineering structure audited and approved by all partner casinos, which ensures:
- Permanent access of depositors to their funds
- Withdrawal capability at any time
- Proportional reserves maintained in liquidity
- Impossibility of blocking or freezing funds

### **On-Chain Verification**
The entire transaction history can be publicly audited:
- Each deposit generates traceable events
- Completely transparent fund flow from contract ‚Üí Uniswap V3
- Impossible to move funds without public record

### **Fund Segregation**
- Investor funds isolated from player funds
- Independent smart contracts with distinct permissions
- Impossible to mix or redirect funds between systems

## üí∞ Returns Model

Returns for investors come exclusively from revenues generated by players from partner casinos distributed globally. Liquidity deposited in Uniswap V3 serves as a technical reserve, ensuring immediate availability for withdrawals.

## üåê Network Information

- **Blockchain**: Arbitrum One (Layer 2)
- **Base Token**: USDC (0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831)
- **DEX**: Uniswap V3
- **Liquidity Pair**: WETH/USDC

## üìÑ Repository Contracts

- `PoolPays.sol` - Main liquidity management contract
- `Authorized.sol` - Access control and permissions system

## üîç Audit and Verification

All contracts are verified on Arbiscan and can be audited by anyone:
1. Access the addresses provided above
2. View the verified source code
3. Analyze transaction history
4. Confirm administrative privilege renunciation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Disclaimer

This protocol operates in a decentralized and autonomous manner. Conduct your own audit before interacting with the contracts.
